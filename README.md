From PEP8:
> Package and Module Names Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. 
> Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. 
> Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.
> 
> Since module names are mapped to file names, 
> and some file systems are case insensitive and truncate long names, 
> it is important that module names be chosen to be fairly short -- this won't be a problem on Unix, 
> but it may be a problem when the code is transported to older Mac or Windows versions, or DOS.
